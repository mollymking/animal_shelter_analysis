I am a gentle and loving cat who likes to take things slow. I may get nervous in new situations, so I am looking for a family who understands that I might need some time to warm up. Once I get to know you, I will be a very devoted friend!<p/><p/>A veterinarian has diagnosed or tentatively diagnosed the above-described pet with the following condition(s):<p/><p/>1)     This animal has been diagnosed as hyperthyroid.

An allergy is an over-reaction of the immune system to an allergen.  Allergies may affect the skin, respiratory or gastrointestinal system.  Symptoms may include itching, inflammation and hair loss, coughing, sneezing or digestive disorders.  Allergies can be caused by environmental factors, fleas or foods.  Allergies can lead to secondary problems such as skin and ear infection, or asthma.  Controlling the allergen is the best treatment.  Antihistamines, medicated shampoos, hypoallergenic diets and routine flea control are some treatment options.  We recommend that you consult with your regular veterinarian about this condition.  Continued veterinary care and additional treatment will be needed.<p/><p/>2)  Cystitis and history of crystalluria.  This cat is on a prescription diet to control her crystalluria.

I may get nervous in new situations, so I am looking for a family who understands that I might need some time to warm up. Once I get to know you, I will be a very devoted friend!<p/><p/>I am an affectionate lovebug who would be thrilled to cuddle up with you at home!<p/><p/>I like getting attention on my own terms. I can get overstimulated with petting, so please move carefully with me and keep an eye out for signs that I might need a break.<p/><p/>My caregivers have noticed that I do not seem to get along with other cats, so I may do best as the only cat in my new home.<p/><p/>Because of my shy nature, I would do best in a calm, quiet adult home.<p/><p/>A veterinarian has diagnosed or tentatively diagnosed the above-described pet with the following condition(s):<p/><p/>1)     Mild weakness and incoordination in the hind end- This cat came in with weakness and inccordination in her hind legs.  She was treated with a week of antiinflammatories and has shown some improvement.  Her signs could be due to intervetebral disc disease (""slipped disc"")  or could be caused by other issues such as a degenerative muscle disease.  She is able to move around normally at this point, but she may be having issues using the litterbox.  Please consult with your regular veterinarian about the best treatment plan for her.<p/><p/>2)  Grade 1/6 heart murmur- A heart murmur was detected on physical examination.  This means there is an abnormal heart sound when we listen to the heart.  In some animals, this can indicate heart disease.  However, other animals can have heart murmurs and never show any symptoms of heart disease.  We recommend that you follow up with your regular veterinarian.<p/><p/>As a result of these conditions, your pet may need specialized care consisting of any or all of the below.  Please note this is not intended to be an exhaustive list.<p/><p/>- Special diet or prescription foods<p/>- Prescription or over-the-counter medicines<p/>- Special skin care or shampoos<p/>- Regular veterinarian visits, which may include blood tests or other monitoring<p/>- Possible surgery or other procedures as determined by your veterinarian<p/><p/> Adoption Fee: $30.00<p/>",BLUE

She mostly loves to be cozy and lazy (as she should at her age!) but can sometimes be convinced to play with the right toy. She doesn't seem to love on being held or cuddled (she tends to squirm) but she loves to hang out and sleep right next to you. She's a love bug at night and will purr in your ears all night if you let her! She has been completely indifferent to her foster family's other cats, and has also been very tolerant of their hyper puppy. She even gave the puppy head butts when the pup calmed down enough! She seems like the kind of cat that could adapt to any kind of household, even at her age. All she needs is lots of love.<p/>She also may be a chronic URI kitty, with cold symptoms that may come and go, but she seems happy and lively nonetheless!<p/>Adoption Fee: $30.00<p/>",GREEN

My name is Kingston and I am available for adoption.<p/><p/>I was brought in by my previous owner on September 20, 2018 because I was not settling into my new home well after moving. My previous owner described me as very smart, sweet, gentle, and playful. They also did say that I can be a little too protective at times. I would do best with some additional positive reinforcement training so that I can learn to relax and trust.<p/><p/>I am full of energy and I love to play! I especially love fetch! I tend to calm down more when the people around me stay calm. I do best when I have lots of exercise and something to keep my mind busy. The volunteers at the shelter say that I walk great on leash and am much calmer when outside of my kennel. I am an equal mix between cuddly and indepedent. <p/><p/>I am a very smart dog! I have shown my caregivers that I already know how to ""sit"", ""stay"", ""come"", and ""shake"" and I can't wait to learn more!<p/><p/>My caregivers have observed that I might not get along with other dogs. I may do best as the only dog in my new home or need to meet other dogs in the home first.<p/><p/>My personality color is RED. I am a spirited dog with a fun-loving personality!  I am full of energy and I love to play! I do best when I have lots of exercise and something to keep my mind busy.

I can get overstimulated with petting, so please move carefully with me and keep an eye out for signs that I might need a break. My previous owner had noticed that I do not seem to get along with other cats, so I may do best as the only cat in my new home.<p/><p/>I was previously declawed on my front paws.

This means that thyroid gland is producing an excess of hormones.  This disease can be easily managed with daily medication, radioactive iodine treatment or prescription diet.  Please follow up with you regular veterinarian to create a treatment plan.  We have also included a handout with more information about this disease.<p/><p/>2)    History of urinating out of the box.  This is likely related to his hyperthyroidism, but may also be behavioral or situational.<p/><p/>3)  Moderate to severe dental disease.  A dental cleaneing is needed and extractions are likely. <p/><p/>As a result of these conditions, your pet may need specialized care consisting of any or all of the below.  Please note this is not intended to be an exhaustive list.<p/><p/>- Special diet or prescription foods<p/>- Prescription or over-the-counter medicines<p/>- Special skin care or shampoos<p/>- Regular veterinarian visits, which may include blood tests or other monitoring<p/>- Possible surgery or other procedures as determined by your veterinarian<p/><p/><p/><p/>Adoption Fee: $30.00<p/>",GREEN

I am learning to trust people, but still get very scared with strangers, noises, and the big world in general.  After I warm up to you, I enjoy getting petted on my cheeks and head and a little on my body.  I am learning to walk on a leash and I am realizing going for walks is quite interesting and I like them!<p/><p/>I really enjoy being around other calm dogs.  They relax me quite a bit and I trust them more than humans right now.<p/><p/>My personality color is RED. I am a gentle and loving dog who likes to take things slow. I may get nervous in new situations, so I am looking for a family who understands that I might take some time to warm up. Once I get to know you, I will be a very devoted friend!<p/><p/>Because of my shy nature, I would do best in a calm, quiet home.<p/><p/>I would do best in a home with older children.<p/> Adoption Fee: $200.00<p/>",

My name is Li and I am available for adoption.<p/><p/>I was brought in by a good samaritan on January 26th, 2019.<p/><p/>Hi there, I'm what you would call an undersocialized kitten. It doesn't mean anything bad it just means when I was wee little one, I was not taught about how nice and awesome people can be to me. I'm very scared at first but once you take the time to show me I can trust you, I will melt in your arms. Although, I'm a fearful kitty, I actually really love to snuggle and purr! I would love to go to a home with a young, confident kitty friend! <p/><p/>My personality color is BLUE. I am a gentle and loving dog who likes to take things slow. I may get nervous in new situations, so I am looking for a family who understands that I might take some time to warm up. Once I get to know you, I will be a very devoted friend!<p/><p/> Adoption Fee: $100.00<p/>",BLUE
